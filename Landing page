      <h2 class="section__headline">Why Most Training Programs Fail Busy Professionals</h2>
      
      <p class="section__intro">
        You're successful in your career. You think long-term. You value systems over quick fixes.
      </p>
      
      <p class="section__intro">
        <strong>But when it comes to fitness, you've been stuck in this cycle:</strong>
      </p>
      
      <!-- Pain Point 1 -->
      <div class="problem__item">
        <h3 class="problem__title">Pain Point #1: Programs Don't Fit Your Reality</h3>
        
        <p>You've tried multiple training plans — some worked for 3 weeks, then life happened.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Work deadlines hit.</strong> Travel schedules change. Stress spikes. Recovery drops.</p>
        
        <p>And the program? It doesn't adapt. It just sits there, demanding you follow a rigid 6-day split designed for someone with unlimited time and zero responsibilities.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The consequence:</strong> You skip workouts. Feel guilty. Eventually quit. Start over next month with a "new program" that fails the exact same way.</p>
      </div>
      
      <!-- Pain Point 2 -->
      <div class="problem__item">
        <h3 class="problem__title">Pain Point #2: You're Relying on Motivation (Which Always Runs Out)</h3>
        
        <p>Here's the truth: <strong>Motivation is not a strategy.</strong></p>
        
        <p>You start strong — excited, committed, consistent. Two weeks in, you're training 5 days a week.</p>
        
        <p>Then motivation fades. You miss Monday. Skip Wednesday. Tell yourself you'll "get back on track next week."</p>
        
        <p><strong>The real problem?</strong> You never built a <strong>structure</strong> — a system that works regardless of how you feel.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The consequence:</strong> You spend years "restarting" instead of progressing. Your body looks the same as it did 3 years ago, despite "trying" multiple times.</p>
      </div>
      
      <!-- Pain Point 3 -->
      <div class="problem__item">
        <h3 class="problem__title">Pain Point #3: You Train Hard But See Minimal Results</h3>
        
        <p>You show up to the gym. You push yourself. You feel the burn.</p>
        
        <p>But <strong>6 months later</strong>, you've gained maybe 2 lbs of muscle. Your lifts barely moved. You're not sure what's working or what to change.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Because effort without <strong>progressive strategy</strong> is just exercise, not training.</p>
        
        <p>No clear progression system. No periodization. No understanding of <strong>volume, intensity, and recovery balance</strong>. No injury prevention strategy.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The consequence:</strong> You plateau. Get frustrated. Wonder if your "genetics" are the problem (they're not — your programming is).</p>
      </div>
      
      <!-- Cost of Inaction -->
      <div class="problem__cta-block">
        <h3 class="problem__title">The Cost of Another Year Without Structure:</h3>
        
        <p>Imagine 12 months from now.</p>
        
        <p>Your career advanced. Your income grew. Your responsibilities increased.</p>
        
        <p><strong>But your body?</strong> Still the same. Maybe worse.</p>
        
        <p>Lower energy. Declining strength. A physique that doesn't reflect the discipline you bring to everything else.</p>
        
        <p><strong>You deserve better.</strong> And there's a better way.</p>

        <!-- Pillar 1 -->
        <div class="pillar">
          <div class="pillar__number">01</div>
          <h3 class="pillar__title">Science-Based Programming That Adapts to Your Life</h3>
          
          <p>Your program is <strong>custom-built</strong> — not a template.</p>
          
          <p>I analyze your schedule, stress levels, recovery capacity, training history, and goals. Then I design a progressive overload system that fits your reality.</p>
          
          <p><strong>What this means:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you travel for work, your program adapts (hotel gym modifications, volume adjustments)</li>
            <li>If stress is high, we manage intensity intelligently (CNS recovery matters)</li>
            <li>If you miss a session, we adjust — no guilt, no "starting over," just continuity</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>The result:</strong> Consistent progress without burnout, injuries, or unsustainable effort.</p>

        <!-- Pillar 2 -->

          <div class="pillar__number">02</div>
          <h3 class="pillar__title">Movement Quality & Injury Prevention (Kinesiologist-Backed)</h3>
          
          <p>Most trainers focus on <strong>how much weight</strong> you lift.</p>
          
          <p>I focus on <strong>how well you move</strong> — because poor mechanics destroy long-term progress.</p>
          
          <p>As a kinesiologist, I analyze your movement patterns, identify compensation issues, and build corrective work into your program.</p>
          
          <p><strong>What this means:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>You learn proper technique for compound lifts (squat, deadlift, press, pull)</li>
            <li>We address mobility restrictions and muscle imbalances before they become injuries</li>
            <li>You build a body that's <strong>strong AND durable</strong> — not just temporarily jacked</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>The result:</strong> You train for decades, not months. Zero injuries. Sustainable strength.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Pillar 3 -->
        <div class="pillar">
          <div class="pillar__number">03</div>
          <h3 class="pillar__title">Sustainable Habit Architecture (No Willpower Required)</h3>
          
          <p>Motivation fades. <strong>Systems last.</strong></p>
          
          <p>I don't coach you to "find your why" or watch motivational videos. I build structure — training schedules, nutrition frameworks, and recovery protocols that <strong>remove decision fatigue</strong>.</p>
          
          <p><strong>What this means:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>You know exactly when you train, what you eat, and how you recover</li>
            <li>No daily "should I work out today?" debates — your calendar decides</li>
            <li>Accountability through weekly video calls (not just app check-ins)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>The result:</strong> Training becomes automatic. You stop "trying" and start <strong>executing</strong>.</p>
